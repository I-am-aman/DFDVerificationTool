# DFD Verification Tool
DFD(Data Flow Diagram) verification tool is to check the correctness of purposed DFD by the user. The tool will take input by user such as number of processes and external entities, level of DFD and process flow of the underlying system. For 
a given set of characteristics needed in a software, the project aims to verify the DFD model and if there is any 
error it will display that error. This project can help user to draw correct Data flow diagrams.

## Features, Functions and Major Benefits
1. The tool will take input by user such as number of processes and external entities, level of DFD and process 
flow of the underlying system.
2. Verifying the correctness of the proposed model.
3. Display the errors, if any.
4. This tool can help user to draw correct DFD for the software development, which is crucial part for it.
